# 2048 Game

2048 is a popular single-player sliding puzzle game where players merge numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to reach the number **2048**. The game was developed by **Gabriele Cirulli** in 2014 and gained widespread popularity for its simplicity and addictive gameplay.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to **slide tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them** and create a tile with the value of 2048. Players can continue playing to reach higher numbers, setting their own high scores even after reaching 2048.

### Game Rules

- **Start with two tiles** on a 4x4 grid, each showing either the number 2 or 4.
- **Swipe in any direction** (up, down, left, right) to slide all tiles in that direction.
- **Combine tiles** of the same value to create a new tile with the sum of the two tiles’ values. For example, two tiles with a value of 2 will merge to form a tile with a value of 4.
- **New tiles** (2 or 4) will spawn in a random empty position on the grid after each move.
- The game **ends when no more moves** are possible.

### Goal

The goal is to reach the **2048 tile** by merging smaller tiles. Once the 2048 tile is created, players can either choose to end the game or continue playing to achieve a higher score.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys (or W/A/S/D)**: Move tiles in the corresponding direction (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **R Key**: Restart the game.
- **ESC Key**: Quit the game.

## Scoring

- Each time tiles merge, the resulting tile's value is **added to the player’s score**.
- The score accumulates as the player continues merging tiles, providing incentive to keep playing even after reaching the 2048 tile.

## Strategy Tips

- **Keep your highest-value tile in a corner** to prevent accidental moves that disrupt your setup.
- **Build up the grid by organizing tiles** in descending order toward one corner to maximize merging potential.
- **Avoid moving tiles in ways that break your tile chains** (e.g., moving tiles up or right unexpectedly).
